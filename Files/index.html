			The Free University of Bozen-Bolzano is located in one of the most fascinating European regions, at the crossroads between the German-speaking and Italian economies and cultures. Its trilingualism in teaching and research, its high level of internationalisation as well as an ideal study environment guaranteed by its excellent facilities are some of the reasons why unibz regularly reaches top positions in national and international rankings.

If, on one hand, many of our research projects tackle global environmental, economic, social or technology topics, on the other hand many are deeply rooted in our region. They address the current issues of sustainable use of resources, socio-economic development and lifelong learning within the Alps. The main features of our research are interdisciplinary collaboration and interaction with local companies.

Five PhD programmes help us train a new generation of researchers. Projects with external sources of funding are supported by regional, national and international institutions.

			<h1>A framework for Systematic Analysis of Open Access Journals</h1>
			<h3>Daniel Graziotin, Xiaofeng Wang, Pekka Abrahamsson</h3>

			This article is a contribution towards an understanding of open access (OA) publishing. It proposes an analysis
framework of 18 core attributes, divided into the areas of bibliographic information, activity metrics,
economics, accessibility, and predatory issues. The framework has been employed in a systematic analysis of
30 OA journals in software engineering (SE) and information systems (IS), which were selected from among
386 OA journals in Computer Science from the Directory of OA Journals. An analysis was performed on the
sample of the journals, to provide an overview of the current situation of OA journals in the fields of SE and IS.
The journals were then compared between-group, according to the presence of article processing charges. A
within-group analysis was performed on the journals requesting article processing charges from authors, in
order to understand what is the value added according to different price ranges. This article offers several
contributions. It presents an overview of OA definitions and models. It provides an analysis framework born
from the observation of data and the existing literature. It raises the need to study OA in the fields of SE and IS
while offering a first analysis. Finally, it provides recommendations to readers of OA journals. This paper
highlights several concerns still threatening the adoption of OA publishing in the fields of SE and IS. Among
them, it is shown that high article processing charges are not sufficiently justified by the publishers, which
often lack transparency and may prevent authors from adopting OA.

			  Arguably, a solution for this issue would be to make all research results barrier-free, available on the Internet.
Open access is such an initiative (BOAI 2002; Brown et al. 2003; Max Planck Society 2003). Different open
access models for publishers exist, namely the golden road, the green road, and the hybrid model. Publishers
joining the golden road will have all their journal articles freely accessible. Publishers taking the green road
allow researchers to archive the pre-publication versions of papers on their personal website or in repositories
of publications (Harnad et al. 2008). Subscription-based journals may adopt a hybrid model between the
golden road and the traditional model, where authors pay fees in order to open the electronic versions of
articles on an individual basis (e.g., IEEE, 2013). However, these fees are reported to be higher than those
required by golden open access publishers.
While the increasing willingness of publishers to allow authors to self-archive the pre-publication versions of
articles (Harnad et al. 2008) can elevate the accessibility issue, golden road open access journals would
arguably solve it completely. However, despite the potentially noble intention, the golden open access model
is also being employed for unethical purposes. There are publishers who exploit the open access scholarly
publishing models. These publishers, often called predatory open access publishers, accept a large amount of
submitted papers by charging fees, often omitting editorial and publishing services such as peer review (Butler
2012). Authors transfer their copyright to publishers and are subsequently unable to withdraw their papers
upon the recognition of fraud (Beall 2012a). While some traditional publishers can be considered predatory as
well (Vardi 2012), this study concentrates on open access journals only.

			These provisions apply only to purchasers who are regarded as consumers as per the Law on Consumer Protection. "Customer Consumer" means a natural person who purchases the products or services offered on the website for purposes unrelated to business or a professional activity; to the effects of these terms and conditions, it is assumed that the "Customer Consumer" is not a client who proposes to purchase products or services at the same time inserting their VAT number in the customer registration area of the website. Articles 50 to 63 of the legislative decree no. 206/2005 apply to the Purchase Contracts entered into by Customer Consumers.

			  Under Article 64 of the Law on Consumer Protection (legislative decree 206/2005) in the context of distance contract proposals or contracts negotiated away from business premises, the consumer is entitled to withdraw within ten working days from receipt of goods. The withdrawal must be made by registered mail and sent to the Free University of Bozen/Bolzano, Bozen-Bolzano University Press, Piazza Universit√† 1, 39100 Bolzano. The withdrawal may also be sent by telegram, telex, e-mail or fax if it is followed by a registered letter within 48 hours.

The refund of the purchase price will occur once the goods have been returned undamaged and unused. The goods must be returned to Bozen-Bolzano University Press within ten days from exercising the right of withdrawal. The return costs shall be borne by the consumer. If the returned goods are damaged, used or incomplete, the buyer must provide compensation in proportion to the decrease in the value of the goods. There is no right of withdrawal in accordance with the law on the protection of consumers with regard to newspapers and magazines, as well as to audio and video media and software products, if not returned in their original sealed packaging.
